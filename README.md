7. Run the commands in [generate.ipynb] to generate images.

8. First time you run notebook, it will ask you to install ipykernel, accept this.
 
9. If the program executes successfully, it will output all the generated images to the /images folder, and the metadata to the /metadata folder. The filenames will refer to tokenIds.
